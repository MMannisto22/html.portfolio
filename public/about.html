  Born in 1999 to a Marine and a Jack of Alls Trades and having three Bachelor's degrees, I have a lot of skill sets.
  These skills include Graphic Design, Animation, Geology, Paleontology, Programming, GIS, Geography, Database Management and Creation, and now Full Stack Software Development.

  I live in New Glarus, WI with my husband, two dogs, two rabbits, thirteen guinea pigs, and varied number of fish. 
  I love spending time with my family and pets, crocheting, loom knitting, writing, drawing, and D&D. I've published three fantasy novels and am working on the remaining three in the series.
